# Vintage Keyboard Replacement Plates
This is a repository of possibly useless plate files that maybe fit in vintage keyboards if you are lucky.

This repository is designed for people who, for whatever reason, like the chassis of commonly harvested keyboards more than they like what is harvested from them who would like to repurpose the keyboard's case for other internals. Primarily this is aimed at replacement plates but if there is interest and ability then it could be expanded to replacement PCBs as well. Initially I was interested in making a replacement plate for the WYSE PCE as the chassis is far more interesting than the switches to me but since then I have found several other boards in similar states that I would like to be able to fit with proper internals after someone else has already shucked the switches and/or caps.

The plate files in this repository are not intended to perfectly recreate the original plates but should maybe possibly create a functional alternative. Even though there may be files for several layouts present this project aims only at providing a base for making replacement plates, not on providing a library of every possible layout someone could want in a given case.

You are expected to be able to make changes to the layouts in these files yourself.
